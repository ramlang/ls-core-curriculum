# Problem ---
# input is an array
# output is a value
# problem domain = identifying the duplicate value, returning the duplicate value
# explicit reqs = arrays are unordered, one value within the array occurs twice
# implicit reqs = arrays of integers only, value returned is an integer

# mental model = look at each element in the array, determine if there are more than one of a value, if there is then stop at that iteration and return the value.
