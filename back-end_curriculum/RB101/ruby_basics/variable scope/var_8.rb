# Compared to the previous exercise, the difference here is that we removed the
# initialization of the local variable a in the outer-most scope before invoking
# the each method and passing in a block. This leads to a completely different
# result. We now get an exception when the puts method is invoked with the local
# variable a as an argument on line 7 because the local variable a is not
# defined in this scope.

# The local variable a that is initialized in the block passed to the each
# method has a scope that is local to that block. Since there is no local
# variable named a initialized in a scope external to the scope of that block,
# the expression a = element on line 4 is initialization and not reassignment.
