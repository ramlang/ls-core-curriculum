# In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two
# variables, array1 and array2.

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

# Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.

# my_answer =>

puts array1 == array2 

# Note that == treats two Arrays as equal if they contain the same number of
# elements, and each element in one Array is equal to the corresponding element
# in the second Array.
