# In the code below, a nested array containing three groups of names and
# numbers is assigned to favorites.

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# Flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result should not have any
# subarrays, but should have all of the original strings and numbers from the
# original array:

# my_answer =>

p favorites.flatten


# example_of_answer =>

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten

p flat_favorites

# Use destructive method to permanently modify the array: favorites.flatten!
