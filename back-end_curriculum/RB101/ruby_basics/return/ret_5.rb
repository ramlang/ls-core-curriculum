# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted

def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal

#my_answer =>

# This code prints 'Dinner' because puts is included in the method. 


# correct_answer =>

# This code prints:
# Dinner
# nil

# If we were to use puts meal the code would print:
# Dinner
#

# This is because puts does not print 'nil' it just prints a blank line
